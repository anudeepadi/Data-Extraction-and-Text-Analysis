Quality affordable healthcare vision governments globe. cost Medical service lack sufficient infrastructure detrimental vision. developed countries U.S., reducing healthcare cost agenda point politicians. India, affordable healthcare important “Roti, Kapda Makan” future. Technology play big role reducing healthcare cost making efficient. vast quantity data Hospitals insurance providers.

Big data solve storage issue handling huge volume variety data. historical data patient reduce healthcare drastically. Improving scheduling appointments: tough Physician’s appointment developed countries. friends, senior director multinational bank, appointment hip replacement surgery waiting period months. sit result, didn’t drive office months. waiting period drastically reduced hospital forecast number patients appointments.

Patients diagnosis symptom evident. challenging physician illness illness grows level. Predictive preventive identify individual develop disease. forms health device iWatch capture data send hospital regular interval time. predictive analysis, hospital predict patient develop illness. diagnosis illness doctors patients effectively cost. Predictive treatment reduce number days patient admitted hospital. inpatient treatment costlier outpatient treatment, doctors discharge patients he/she thinks condition patient serious. hospital monitor patient remotely medical sensors patient hospital required. Big data plays big role suffers multiple illnesses. Dr. Abhishek Rai, M.S. Ortho K.E.M. Medical College Mumbai, “It challenging operate patients suffers multiple illnesses. number times, physicians aware issues patients patients aware illness”. example, it’s tough operate suffering diabetes doesn’t coat easily diabetic person. physician doesn’t historical data diabetic person, he/she operate diabetic wrongly. big data analytics play huge role predicting disease genetic disease. breast cancer, 15-20 percent develop breast cancer. big data analytics, system identify patients suffer genetic disease request patients timely screening. Genetic diseases screened first, second- third-degree relatives reduce morbidity mortality. Timely diagnostic reports: India, takes 2-3 days average MRI scan. Delay lack medical instruments lack qualified radiologists. problem mitigated integrating Medical imaging big data. Integration medical imaging big data ensure radiologists report span time. Big data reduce turnaround time required reports reports. Technology convert image graphs charts making easier radiologists report. data works principle abundance scarcity. So, data have, outcomes obtained. Thus, Big Data technology digital disruptor revolutionize healthcare sector consolidating data disparate platforms build 360-degree view human body healthcare provider generate solutions life-threatening problems improved healthcare opportunities.
