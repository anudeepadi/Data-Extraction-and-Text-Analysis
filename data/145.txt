Disruption Fintech – Lightning Network Blockchain Distributed Ledger Technology time now. Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, based Blockchain technology, making entry formal finance world increasingly medium exchange. potential cases Cryptocurrencies Government critical implementing technology banking finance, lot issues resolved commercially transactions. important drawbacks Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin below: Scalability:Bitcoin <7 transactions compared ~47,000 payment network giants VisaThere limit 1MB, amounts 8GBs 10 Bitcoin (to match 47,000 transactions second). essentially home computers process limited cases transactions requiring devices computational powerCentralization:High computation requirement limit usage network afford itThis eventually lead fewer validations Distributed Ledger, defeating purpose Blockchain. (A distributed ledger network validate transaction parties) So, important cheaply validation mechanism carried basic broadband connection in-home/small business computers. people personal transaction history, it’s unimportant posted blockchain time transaction takes bloat blockchain. Moreover, everyday transactions cryptocurrency cost posting transaction for. Let’s buying coffee, itself. Introducing Lightning Network: Lightning Network latest disruptive technology researched Fintech make cryptocurrencies scalable. basically adds extra layer top Bitcoin Blockchain enables payment channels parties layer. Micropayments everyday transactions easily carried channel. works: Suppose buys nearby shop work. decide open channel Blockchain everyday transactions. channel (or Lightning Network) open, parties track transactions ledger. end month, ledger reflecting balances left party, decide channel. final transaction recorded Bitcoin Blockchain. reduces cost transaction enables micropayments everyday transactions. Micropayment channels defer updating blockchain remaining balances date. network micropayments created secondary layer top blockchain address scalability issue reduce transaction fees. solution initial stages, resolving scalability issue reducing transaction fees taking transaction blockchain give big boost Cryptocurrencies. payments lightning network? parties exchange single validation spend transactions. conduct unlimited number transactions channel finally party closes channel, balances added blockchain. user open digital wallet store Bitcoins deposit coins channel opened (this kind security deposit behalf parties honor transaction)Once exchange books updated, sign ledger channelFinally, added blockchain channel closed network globally scalable reach connected channels network, path connect leveraging existing network. network develops future, requirement open separate channel cease exist algorithm automatically find shortest route connect pay based exhaustive peer peer network. ease inter-country transactions internationally seconds. Limitations technology – channel Lightning Network separate connected Blockchain, backed security original Blockchain. concern widespread adoption companies research extensively this. challenge dependency internet. Lightning Network capable storing coins digitally hardware wallet. makes prone hackers wallet online. Also, transferring amounts detailed research, bigger payment struggle routing network. Nevertheless, technology fascinating broad usage implementation Bitcoins Distributed Ledger everyday life. rolled customer experience, micropayments parties Blockchain, wallets transfer purchases. Lightning Network surely big disruption Fintech domain Blockchain. Blackcoffer Insights 11 | Chirag Soni - IIM BANGALORE
