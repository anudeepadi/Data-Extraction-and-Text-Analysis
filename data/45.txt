Machine learning techniques years, recently explosion applications. fact, recent Q3 earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai “Machine learning core, transformative we’re re-thinking we’re everything.” they’re business making claim. past, successful machine learning algorithms required bespoke algorithms huge R&D budgets, changing. IBM Watson, Microsoft Azure, Amazon, Alibaba launched turnkey cloud-based machine-learning SaaS solutions 2015. time startups Idibon, MetaMind, Dato, MonkeyLearn built machine learning products companies advantage of. puts machine learning top hype curve, no: machine learning won’t replace employees computers suddenly double revenue. doesn’t can’t give business competitive advantage. plenty business processes significantly benefit machine learning. machine learning change businesses operate? Fig: Machine learning techniques Business Bigger upfront costs thing’s first: Machine learning training data training data costs money. training data labeled humans. explain. make machine learning work business, algorithm lots lots examples it’s supposed doing. algorithm lead good, show lots lots examples leads bad leads. algorithm tag support tickets show examples support tickets. localize algorithm language collect lots examples language. instances, company training sets in-house. example, disqualified qualified leads. haven’t labeled support tickets they’ve year. You’d people in-house en masse data enrichment platform -label tickets. machine judgments start finding connections patterns learn from. ongoing costs Machine learning cheaper efficient people works well. downside works 80 percent cases badly 20 percent cases, lowering 20 percent error rate hard, impossible. 80 percent accurate algorithm save lot machine learning algorithms accurate errors. companies cases algorithm confidence directly sending confidence cases humans. years. put check ATM, algorithm decipher check. sloppy handwriting ink smudged algorithm passes task human. design pattern saves lots preserving level accuracy. costs drop time huge benefit machine learning turn part variable cost fixed cost. humans handle cases algorithm struggling, creating perfect training data feed algorithm. well-studied technique called active learning turns training data labels collected cases algorithm confidence algorithm learn much, efficiently. algorithm increasingly accurate, unit economics business process machine learning handle cases, expensive humans called toughest, rarest situations. human machine intelligence tandem: leveraging reliability computers easy judgments fluency expertise humans difficult ones. sounds business, it’s is.
